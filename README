Resampling and interpolation of raster maps:
Generates a map of areas at risk of flooding at a resolution of 5 m.
The areas at risk of flooding those whose altitude is below 1450 m
and its slope is less than 3 ยบ. The map generated shows the relief 
and curves level, roads, rivers and flood risk areas in red

Conversion:
Generates a map of the Spearfish National Park (plot 63 on the map
fields), showing the relief and contour lines inside the park and roads
and rivers all over the map.

Creation of an elevation model:
A macro to generate the digital elevation model at a resolution of 15 m
from the active region from vector map contours. To do this we create a 
vector map of contour lines restricted to the active region and create a
map by interpolation v.surf.rst. To reduce the computing time
interpolated to a lower resolution first, then build the final model.

Raster Analysis:
Search potential locations for a brewery in the light you need to have 
water (no more than 200 m) and be close to a road other than the 
interstate (within 200 m). Moreover, the field should be level 
(less than 6 meters), with no less than 22,000 m2.
